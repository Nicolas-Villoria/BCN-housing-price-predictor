Execution Roadmap
Phase 1: Minimal Production System (Week 1-2)
Goal: A working API that serves predictions, deployed on free infrastructure.

Step	Task	Files Changed/Created
1.1	Convert Spark model to sklearn	scripts/convert_to_sklearn.py
1.2	Create FastAPI prediction service	main.py, api/models.py
1.3	Add health check endpoint	main.py
1.4	Containerize API	Dockerfile, .dockerignore
1.5	Deploy API to Railway/Render	railway.json or render.yaml
1.6	Refactor Streamlit to call API	model_service.py
1.7	Deploy Streamlit to Streamlit Cloud	Already compatible
1.8	Upload model to S3	Manual or script
Deliverable: Live demo URL + GitHub repo with Docker setup.

Phase 2: Automation & Retraining (Week 3-4)
Goal: Automated yearly retraining with safe promotion.

Step	Task	Files Changed/Created
2.1	Refactor training to sklearn	scripts/train_sklearn.py
2.2	Create validation script	scripts/validate_model.py
2.3	Create GitHub Actions workflow	.github/workflows/train.yml
2.4	Add PR validation workflow	.github/workflows/validate.yml
2.5	Implement rollback script	scripts/rollback.py
2.6	Add versioning metadata	metadata/versions.json
2.7	Configure S3 artifact storage	Environment secrets
Deliverable: Automated pipeline that runs yearly, with manual trigger option.

Phase 3: Polish for Recruiters (Week 5-6)
Goal: Documentation, explainability, and visual presentation.

Step	Task	Files Changed/Created
3.1	Add SHAP explainability	api/explainability.py
3.2	Create /explain endpoint	main.py
3.3	Update Streamlit UI with explanations	ui.py
3.4	Create architecture diagram (draw.io)	docs/architecture.png
3.5	Write comprehensive README	README.md
3.6	Add badges (tests, deployment, coverage)	README.md
3.7	Record demo video (2-3 min)	docs/demo.mp4 or Loom link
3.8	Write blog post explaining design decisions	Medium/Dev.to
Deliverable: Portfolio-ready project with live demo, clean documentation, and explanatory content.

9. Summary: What Makes This Recruiter-Ready
Aspect	What You'll Demonstrate
System Design	Decoupled architecture, API-first design
MLOps	CI/CD, automated retraining, model validation gates
Production Engineering	Containerization, cloud deployment, health checks
Data Engineering	Medallion architecture, feature engineering
ML Fundamentals	Experiment tracking, hyperparameter tuning, model comparison
Explainability	SHAP integration, user-friendly explanations
Documentation	Architecture diagrams, clear README, demo video
Portfolio Presentation Talking Points
"I designed a decoupled architecture where the inference service is independent of the frontend, enabling horizontal scaling."
"The CI/CD pipeline includes automated model validation gates—if RMSE exceeds threshold, deployment is blocked."
"I chose sklearn over Spark for inference because latency matters more than distributed processing for single predictions."
"Explainability is integrated via SHAP, surfacing the top 3 price drivers in plain language for non-technical users."
"The system runs entirely on free-tier infrastructure, demonstrating cost-conscious engineering."
